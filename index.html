		<title>This Troll.</title>

		<p>This troll is currently in a 6-story hostel in Mexico City. This troll regrets his choice in hostels. It's a big city and probably he could have done better.</p>
		<p>Occurs to him he can't write in third person about himself.</p>
		<p>Maybe it was the overnight bus and lack of sleep and I was just off-kilter. Or maybe it was the uniformed staff and English-speaking clientele that after two
			months of Mexico made me feel like an asshole.</p>
		<p>But there was that douchey French dude who I let use my phone charger this morning who promised me shots and a huge band but I later saw at the hostel bar talking
			different bullshit but still bullshit.</p>

		<p>And there was the door guy at the rooftop bar who turned me away and didn't know where the washing machine was, but after I found out from a guy on the 5th floor
			that the washing machine was through that door at the top of the stairs right next to the bar, the door guy deferred to me and I got to do my laundry with too much
			over-priced liquid soap in a bag from the 1st floor hotel guy.</p>

		<p>I had a weak martini on the 3rd floor terrace of a bar near here tonight.</p>

		<p>I had a more memorable experience buying a taco at a restaurant/street taco stand near here. I failed miserably at it and it lightened my mood. I at least had to
		talk in Spanish. The taco tasted awesome too.</p>

		<p>I tried to enter an industrial show and turned away after the door guy told me I had to check my mace, which was pretty embarrassing. My two American roommates (who
		may be cooler than I give them credit for I think after finding 4 big bottles of water and 1 big bottle of vodka - it's a dad and son routine) told me when I showed
		up that THREE different guys they have shared a room with in this hostel have been robbed on the subway. Walt (the dad) told me two second-hand anecdotes. I think 3
		was probably 2. One was a pickpocket story where the good guy grabbed the bandit's hand but then he pulled a knife and who knows. In the other story 5 latinos including
		2 latinas surrounded our hero and so what could he do? This sounds pretty far-fetched to me now, but for the first time since I left the U.S. I carried the mace I bought
		before leaving in my pocket. I'm also sleep-deprived and drunk. It seemed like a good idea. But I'm not going to check it. Too complicated.</p>

		<p>After that I decided to buy 7-11 beers. I went back to the hostel and found a corner in the "common space" (I think they're letting me hang out in the "huï¿½sped
		zona" of the restaurant) - and read From Here To Eternity, which I was expecting to be one of my least favorite books of the year but is turning into one of my
		favorites. Also continued to text furiously with some awesome friends, which I didn't mention but definitely helped.</p>
