			<h1>Hello World</h1>
			<h2>July 15, 2017</h2>
			<p>Hello world!</p>
			<p>Mike here, sitting on a couch in a Chiapas hostel watching rain pound against the glass ceiling.</p>
			<p>I have been on the road about two months now. I plan to start writing a travel blog on this website. I'll back up to the beginning too. Promise.</p>
			<p>I also am excited to create a troll which I will set to guard my blog. He won't be too talkative at first, but go easy on him. Trolls are slow learners. And I plan to teach him a thing or two.</p>
			<p>The pieces are in place, as many a sports coach would say. I have an EC2 tomcat instance up and running with connectivity to a DynamoDB instance. I have an S3 bucket serving up a static website. Next up I need to learn a couple JS technologies and
				get a FE build running. Still waiting on a troll media package as well. But things are coming along.</p>
			<p>In other news, the World Series of Poker Day 5 chip leader is an Argentinian poker pro who played at my table during last year's main event. I paid him off on a big pot where he rivered the nuts with a 9-high straight and I had the second nuts with
				an 8-high straight. I will be vehemently rooting against him. My favorite poker player - Liv Boeree - has been eliminated, but not before winning me $100 in this year's WSOP pool! So that's cool.</p>
			<p>Hasta luego. Tengo trabajo hacer.</p>
